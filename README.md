# Black Box Optimization

A package for applying hyperparameter tuning algorithms on a black box function which defines an optimization problem

Another attempt at making an all-in-one hyperparameter optimization package. High-level abstraction allows algorithms to be implemented independently of search space constraints. Inspiration pulled from `ray[tune]` and `hyperopt`.
